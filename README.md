Weex isn’t just handing out a small welcome gift — it’s offering a full-scale bonus program that can reach up to **30,000 USDT**. And this isn’t a vague number thrown around for marketing. It’s a structured, tiered bonus system based on your real trading activity.

Here’s a breakdown of how the reward program works when you use referral code (ckk0):

Each level unlocks automatically — no need to manually claim rewards.

**🎯 3. Copy Trading Bonus**

If you use Weex’s built-in Copy Trading system — where you follow top-performing traders — you also become eligible for special reward pools. Weex often runs limited-time bonus programs for users who:

Start copying trades

Maintain consistent activity

Achieve certain profit milestones

It’s a great way to earn while you learn.

**🛡 4. Exclusive Campaigns for Referral Users**

Accounts registered with referral code (ckk0) sometimes gain early access to:

Flash bonus campaigns

VIP service upgrades

These benefits are not always available to users who register without a code.

**Final Note**

Most exchanges give you $5 here, $10 there. Weex gives you up to 30,000 USDT, and that’s not marketing fluff — it’s a performance-based bonus system tied to your activity.
